# PS_Calc — Session Roadmap
_Gap IDs reference docs/gaps.md. Pipeline specs in docs/pipeline_specs.md._

## Context Budget Reference (from actual session data)

| Session type | Est. tokens | Typical ctx% |
|---|---|---|
| Pure GUI / no Hercules | 20–30k | 40–60% |
| Mixed implementation | 30–40k | 60–80% |
| Investigation-heavy | 40–50k | 80–100% |

**Planning rule**: If a session requires Hercules greps, budget 1–2 greps max alongside
implementation. Never plan investigation + large GUI change + doc maintenance together.
Hit-limit risk rises sharply past 3 Hercules reads in one session.

Fixed overhead per session (CLAUDE.md + system + conversation): ~6k tokens.
Doc maintenance (gaps.md + completed_work.md + context_log.md update): ~3–5k.

## Session J — Party buffs

**Goal**: Implement confirmed Bard/Dancer song SCs in StatusCalculator + new Party Buffs UI panel.
**Gap IDs**: G9~ (SC_ASSNCROS), new items for SC_POEMBRAGI, SC_APPLEIDUN, DC_FORTUNEKISS, DC_SERVICEFORYOU and other Songs
**Estimated tokens**: ~35–45k (new UI sub-section + multiple formula implementations + possible new StatusData fields)

**All confirmed formulas are in `docs/BARD_DANCER_SONGS.md` — no Hercules research needed for these six.**
BA_WHISTLE and DC_HUMMING still need a targeted grep before implementation.

### Design decision (discuss with user before coding):

Add a "Party Buffs" collapsible sub-group to `passive_section.py` (placeholder already exists).
The sub-group needs a "song caster" input panel: AGI, DEX, VIT, INT, LUK spinboxes + song level
per active song + BA_MUSICALLESSON / DC_DANCINGLESSON passive levels.

Alternatively: expose SCs as toggles with manual val2 sliders (simpler; avoids caster stat inputs).
Tradeoff: caster stat inputs are accurate and educational; manual sliders are faster to implement.

### Work items (in order):

1. **Party Buffs UI panel** — add caster stat inputs + per-song enable/level controls to `passive_section.py`

2. **SC_ASSNCROS — complete G9~**
   Formula (from BARD_DANCER_SONGS.md): `val2 = (MusLesson_lv/2 + 10 + song_lv + caster_agi/10) * 10`
   Wire into `status_calculator.py` ASPD reduction block (already scaffolded; currently does nothing).

3. **SC_APPLEIDUN** — MaxHP %: `val1 = 5 + 2*song_lv + caster_vit/10 + MusLesson_lv`
   Apply as `max_hp = max_hp * (100 + val1) // 100` in StatusCalculator.

4. **DC_FORTUNEKISS** — CRI: `val1 = (10 + song_lv + caster_luk/10 + DanceLesson_lv) * 10`
   Apply as flat cri bonus (note: 10× scale → divide by 10 when adding to cri).

5. **DC_SERVICEFORYOU** — MaxSP% + SP cost reduction:
   `val1 = 15 + song_lv + caster_int/10 + DanceLesson_lv/2` (MaxSP%)
   `val2 = 20 + 3*song_lv + caster_int/10 + DanceLesson_lv/2` (SP cost %)
   MaxSP: same pattern as APPLEIDUN. SP cost reduction: new `status.sp_cost_reduction` field if needed.

6. **SC_POEMBRAGI** — cast time + after-cast delay reduction. Requires new StatusData fields
   (`cast_time_reduction_pct`, `after_cast_delay_reduction_pct`) and display rows in derived_section.
   `val1 = 3*song_lv + caster_dex/10 + 2*MusLesson_lv` (cast time %)
   `val2 = (song_lv<10 ? 3*song_lv : 50) + caster_int/5 + 2*MusLesson_lv` (after-cast %)

7. **BA_WHISTLE + DC_HUMMING** — HIT/FLEE/HIT bonuses. Grep first, implement after.

## Deferred

| Item | Reason deferred |
|---|---|
| **G41 — PC VIT DEF discrepancy** | LOW PRIORITY. Hercules comment vs C code disagree. Investigate vs official server data before any fix. Currently following C implementation. |
| **Phases 5–8** | Stat Planner, Comparison, Histogram, Config/Scale tabs. |
